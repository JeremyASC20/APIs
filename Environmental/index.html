Since 2019, the global temperature has risen over 1 degree Celcius, which is melting ice and increasing the sea level around the world. </h3>

                <h3>Carbon Dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas, traps heat inside the surface of the Earth. CO2 is crucial for humans to survive because, without it, Earth would be freezing. However, as CO2 builds up in our atmosphere from burning fossil fuels, it has a warming effect that could change the earthâ€™s climate. Excess amount of CO2 on our planet is the primary consequence of the melting ice. </h3>
